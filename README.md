# Commons OS

**The forkable operating system for living systems.**

Commons OS is a complete operating environment for any commons — an organisation, a city district, a personal system, an ecological watershed, or any community that chooses to govern itself as a living system.

## Why

The Cognitive Age creates extraordinary new possibilities for shared value creation — at every scale, from a local cooperative to a global enterprise. But without deliberate architecture, the tools, platforms, and intelligence of this era concentrate into fewer hands. Organisations become tenants of their own future.

**A commons systematically creates value that is alive, shared, just, and built to last.**

Commons OS is the infrastructure that makes this buildable. It gives every commons — regardless of domain — the same quality of sovereign operating system that today only trillion-dollar platforms possess. Human-governed. AI-driven. Open source. Near-zero cost.

## How to Start Your Commons

There are three ways to begin, depending on your needs:

| Path | Best for | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Template** (private) | Individuals, internal teams, private experiments | Click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository** → choose **Private** → follow `BOOT.md` |
| **Fork** (public) | Open source projects, public communities | Click **Fork** → follow `BOOT.md` |
| **Lighthouse** (guided) | Established organisations seeking a co-creation partnership | [Contact Commons Engineering](mailto:contact@commons.engineering) |

### After You Template or Fork

1. **Rename** your repository to `[your-commons]` (e.g., `luebeck-os`, `my-life`, `acme-commons`)
2. **Edit** `.commons/identity.yml` — set your slug, name, purpose, domain, and locale
3. **Copy** `AGENT.md.template` → `AGENT.md` — this is the OS-standard AI governance configuration
4. **Wire** your AI tool to `AGENT.md` (see `BOOT.md` for tool-specific instructions)
5. **Read** `BOOT.md` — the Purpose Agent guides you through the founding conversation

The boot process takes 2-4 hours. It is a founding act, not a setup wizard. The quality of your boot determines everything that follows.

## What You Get

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Commons** | Upstream patterns, manifests, specifications, templates — with upstream sync |
| **Extensions** | Domain-specific extension packs (business-essentials, urban-essentials, life-essentials, ecology-essentials) |
| **Instance** | Your space — registry (workspace), operations, portals, workshop, and local patterns |
| **Agent Configuration** | AI-ready governance with 4-agent board architecture |
| **Living Blueprint** | Single-document, 9-layer architecture for your commons |
| **MCP Connections** | Shared intelligence (Commons MCP) + local knowledge (Blueprint MCP) + your systems (Fabric MCPs) |

### The Four Universal Dimensions

Every commons, regardless of domain, operates across four dimensions:

| Dimension | What it governs |
|---|---|
| **D1 — Definition & Purpose** | Direction, governance, impact, architectural integrity |
| **D2 — Participation & Relationship** | Community, stakeholders, workforce, non-human participants |
| **D3 — Proposition & Exchange** | Value creation, products, services, knowledge exchange |
| **D4 — Production & Resilience** | Infrastructure, production lines, delivery, economics |

Each dimension has an **agent** (conversational governance) and may have **engines** (production at volume, supervised by D4).

### The Intelligence Grid

Your fork connects you to a shared intelligence network:

| Asset | Scale |
|---|---|
| **Documented patterns** | 64,000+ across business, urban, ecology, and life |
| **Business lighthouses** | 1,000+ documented organisations |
| **Urban lighthouses** | 1,400+ documented places |
| **Access method** | Model Context Protocol (MCP) — native AI retrieval |

Every pattern and lighthouse is connected through a knowledge graph and retrievable for every Commons OS fork.

### Three Layers

| Layer | Path | Who owns it | Sync behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Commons** | `commons/` | Upstream (commons-os template) | Read-only in forks, updated via upstream sync |
| **Extensions** | `extensions/{provider}/{pack}/` | Pack providers (any Commons Incubator) | Loaded via Commons MCP, cached locally |
| **Instance** | `instance/` | Your commons | Yours entirely — upstream never touches it |

### Everything is Open
